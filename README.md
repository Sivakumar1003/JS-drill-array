## Array Methods Covered

1. **forEach**: Executes a provided function once for each array element.
2. **filter**: Creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
3. **find**: Returns the value of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function.
4. **flatten**: Flattens nested arrays into a single array.
5. **map**: Creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.
6. **reduce**: Executes a reducer function on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value.
